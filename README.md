# SPLFLIX

**SPLFLIX** offers users two types of streaming content â€“ movies and tv-episodes,
which belong to a given tv-series. Like most
streaming services we allow a creation of
multiple users, while each user receives userspecific recommendations, according to his
watch history.
However, on SPLFLIX, unlike current
streaming services, we give our users the
ability to choose which recommendation
algorithm to use, out of a number of algorithms
we offer. Each user stores its own watch history, and can use a different recommendation
algorithm. After the user chooses to watch a content, a recommendation can be given to the
user for the next content.
